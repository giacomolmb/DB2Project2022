## Description

Aim of this project is to develop a platform to manage package sales for an imaginary ICT company, TELCO.  
The architecture of the platform consists of a MySQL database and a backend server developed using Java Servlets. The database-server communication is managed through JPA ORM.  
In order to interact with the server, a simple frontend built using HTML, Thymeleaf, JavaScript and Bootstrap is also implemented.
